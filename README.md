# Termz 

> Setup terminals on your own terms.

## What and why is Termz?

### What

Termz is a CLI tool that automatically sets up your terminal sessions for you. Termz aims for a consistent usage across all platforms, and it works with various different IDEs and terminal applications.

### Why

Imagine a project where you have to open multiple terminal tabs and run multiple different commands to get started.
It can be annoying to keep setting that up every time you work on the project. With Termz you only have to write a configuration once, and it will automatically open all the required tabs when you run `termz`.

npm i -g termz@latest
